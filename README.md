# Android Dev Assistant

**Android Dev Assistant** is a productivity tool for macOS designed to help Android developers save time. It combines essential tools for debugging and testing into one intuitive interface that anyone can use.

## Features

1. **Quick APK Installation/Management**
   
   Drag and drop the apk file from your project's build filter to quickly install the latest build with a click. After installation, you can also cold restart or uninstall the app directly from the assistant.

2. **Screenshot Edit + Sharing**
   
   Capture a screenshot on your device directly from your Mac, and it will be copied to your clipboard. You can also click the preview to crop/highlight a particular section before sharing it.

3. **Display Size Switching**
   
   Mock a different display size/ratio on your device with just a click. Note: You will need to enable WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS in the developer settings for this to work. After you switch to the default size, restart your device to avoid UI bugs.

4. **View Last Crash**

   Check the last crash logs on your device with a click, sorted from most recent to oldest.

5. **Off-Commit File Search**

   View a file's state on another branch/commit without switching your current branch. Designed for large projects where switching branches could easily take a couple of minutes.

## Installation

1. Download the latest dmg file on your Mac.
2. Double-click to open, then drag and drop the app into the application folder.
3. Open the Android Dev Assistant app.
